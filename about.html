          TED is on a mission to discover and spread ideas that spark imagination,
          embrace possibility and catalyze impact. Our organization is devoted to
          curiosity, reason, wonder and the pursuit of knowledge — without an agenda.
          We welcome people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper
          understanding of the world and connection with others, and we invite
          everyone to engage with ideas and activate them in your community. 
          
          <br><br>

          TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and
          Design converged, but today it spans a multitude of worldwide communities
          and initiatives exploring everything from science and business to education,
          arts and global issues. In addition to the hundreds of TED Talks curated
          from our annual conferences and published on TED.com, we produce original
          podcasts, short video series,
          <a href="https://ed.ted.com" target="_blank">animated educational lessons (TED-Ed)</a>
          and TV programs that are translated into more than 100 languages and
          distributed via partnerships around the world. Each year, more than 3,000
          independently run
          <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx/events" target="_blank">TEDx events</a>
          bring people together to share ideas and bridge divides in communities on
          every continent. Through the Audacious Project, TED has helped catalyze
          more than $3 billion in funding for projects that seek to make the world
          more beautiful, sustainable and just. In 2020, TED launched Countdown,
          an initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis and mobilize
          a movement for a net-zero future. View a full list of

          TED is owned by a nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation.
          Our aim is to help create a future worth pursuing for all.

        <h3>x = independently organized event</h3>
        <p>
          in the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local,
          self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
          experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine
          to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized
          events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.
          The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
          individual TEDx events are self-organized.
          (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          To cultivate a dynamic platform at SRM Institute of Science and Technology
          where ideas ignite change, voices inspire progress, and diverse perspectives
          shape a better future—empowering individuals to think deeply, act boldly,
          and innovate responsibly.
        </p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to amplify powerful ideas by organizing thought-provoking
          TED-style events that bring together students, faculty, alumni, and
          changemakers from all walks of life. We aim to foster a culture of
          intellectual curiosity, creativity, and social responsibility by:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Showcasing transformative stories and groundbreaking research</li>
          <li>Encouraging interdisciplinary dialogue and critical thinking</li>
          <li>Inspiring the SRM community to drive positive change locally and globally</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Through these efforts, we seek to contribute meaningfully to the global
          TEDx movement while reflecting the academic excellence and innovation ethos
          of SRM Institute of Science and Technology.
